    "More specifically, for each ratio we will look at the spread of returns of stocks with high or low values of the ratios. We will think of that spread as telling us about the returns of a corresponding investment strategy, and we will evaluate the spread using the Fama-French 3-factor model. This model will reveal that a strategy based on ratio #1 is economically no different from investing in a simple value strategy. On the other hand, a strategy based on ratio #2 will indeed represent something new. This second ratio is the basis for the well-known \"profitability\" strategy that is widely implemented today.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic reason for the different results using the two different ratios, is that *any* strategy based on a price ratio will tend to steer you towards the same set of value stocks. Prices move around so much that nothing else can really come through in the data. In this case, portfolios formed on cash flow to price are very similar to our typical value portfolios, which are based on book value to price. When we switch the denominator to something more stable, there is at least the opportunity for this strategy to look different."

    "This is not surprising when you think about it: We sorted on cash flow to *price*. Investment strategies based on any ratio involving price is going to look a lot like a strategy based on HML, because stock price is so much more volatile than any other financial variable. You could say that HML already captures the general idea of trading on any ratio of \"price over anything\" or \"anything over price\".\n",

    "This doesn't mean that investing based on \"cashflow over price\" is a *bad* strategy, just that it's nothing new.

Now we see that investing based on \"profitability over price\" would steer us toward the same stocks and generate the same performance. \n",

The main difference is the use of book assets instead of market value in the denominator.

A risk-averse investor should *expect* a higher return from the market than any of the others. The point of constructing the other zero-beta factors is to find something that is valuable to hold alongside the market. So, let's redo the figure without the market return."

However, the careful measurement here shows that these patterns also come and go. Why did this strategy suddenly improve so much over the last five years? Why is it present in the first place, given that everyone in the market knows that profitable companies are good ones? Shouldn't the prices of those stocks rise to the point that the returns go away? Factor models give us a way to quantify these questions but cannot answer them."
